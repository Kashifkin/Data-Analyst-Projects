📊 Data Analyst Portfolio

A collection of end-to-end Data Analysis and ETL projects

Welcome to my Data Analyst Portfolio Repository.
This repo contains multiple real-world datasets where I performed:

✔ ETL (Extract → Transform → Load)

✔ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

✔ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

✔ Visualization

✔ Statistical Insights

✔ Correlation Analysis

✔ Machine Learning (Scikit-Learn)

Each project focuses on converting raw data into meaningful insights using Python and analytical techniques.
